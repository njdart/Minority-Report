# Minority Report

## About

This project started as an industrial year/gap year project whilst working at [Cambridge Consultants](http://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/). The aim of the project was to reproduce some of the human-computer interactions displayed in the film by the same name; a key problem of many development environments is transferring information from a hi-fidelity physical world where we all interact to a lo-fidelity digital world where many of us work.
